    "GPT-4o is a fully multimodal model by OpenAI released in May 2024. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance in text and code, and has significantly improved vision and audio capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expanded vision/audio capabilities mean that it can be used for document parsing, by treating each page as an image and performing document extraction. Llama-index supports using GPT-4o natively in LlamaParse for document parsing. The notebook below walks you through an example of using GPT-4o over the Tesla-Q3-2023-Update-3 report."
